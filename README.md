# BTHS Girls Who Code Black History Hacks

## Created By: 
Corinna Chen, Samantha Pang, and Aliaa Mahgoub

## Inspiration
We can up with this idea after thinking about how society doesn't talk about how politics and movements bring people together. We included two states from every region to show that no matter where in the US a person may be, there is support for Black Lives Matter.

## How we built it
- Collaborated via Repl.it and Google Suite
- Coded in HTML and CSS

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Learning how hackathons work
- Building a dropdown navigation bar
- Winning first place! üèÜ
