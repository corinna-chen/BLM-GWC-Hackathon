        <h2> George Floyd </h2> 
        <p> The The George Floyd protests in Minneapolisâ€“Saint Paul began in the U.S. state of Minnesota on May 26, 2020, as a response to the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man who died on May 25 after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes as three other officers assisted during an arrest. Civil unrest in Minneapolis quickly spread to other cities and inspired a global protest movement against police brutaility and racial inequality. Four days after killing George Floyd by kneeling on his neck during an arrest, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder. This was later updated to second-degree murder. The three other police officers present at Floyd's arrest have also been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. Minneapolis lawmakers vowed to disband the city's police department less than two weeks after Floyd's death.</p>
